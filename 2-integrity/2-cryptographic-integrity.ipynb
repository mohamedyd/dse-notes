    "## Cryptographic Hash Functions\n",
    "A cryptographic hash function is a particularly strng hash function that is suitable for use in cryptography. Essentially, it is a hash function that is very hard to \"reverse engineer\" (look at a hash value and figure out an input that generates it). Like a regular hash function, it maps data of arbitrary size (often called the \"message\") to a bit string of a fixed size (the \"hash value\", \"hash\", or \"message digest\"). Ideally, the only way to find a message that produces a given hash is to attempt a brute-force search of possible inputs to see if they produce a match. The reason that we don't always use cryptographic hashes is that they are expensive to compute and if you have no reason to defend against intentional manipulation, they are wasteful to use. Python has libraries for computing such hashes:"

Such a problem can happen in a decentralized setting where each node in a network has its own data and hosts its own signature.

These signatures of signatures can be copied and placed on multiple different nodes to decentralize the trust."
