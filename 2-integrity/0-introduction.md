# Data Integrity
Data integrity is about protecting data against improper maintenance, modification, or alteration. Integrity has to do with the accuracy of information, including its authenticity and trustworthiness. Information with low integrity concerns may be considered unimportant to precise operational functions or not necessary to vigorously check for errors. Information with high integrity concerns is considered critical and must be accurate in order to prevent negative impact on University activities.

## Threat Models
The first question that we should ask is "why might our data be wrong?". There are several considerations:
- Sytactic corruption: errors in the underlying storage or software system lead to incorrect data
- Semantic corruption: values are incorrect at a semantic level and are consequence of human or software error 



- CRC
- Hashing (Merkle Tree)
- Integrity Constraints
- Functional Dependencies
- Referential Integrity
