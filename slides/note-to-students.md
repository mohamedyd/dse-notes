Dear Students,

I hope you are all staying safe and are well. I'd like to spend a few moments to discuss the logistics of CMSC 13600 Data Engineering for the Spring Quarter. I fully understand that we are all facing an unprecedented crisis and my primary objective is that all students are able to meet their academic and intellectual goals during the course of the quarter. So this is going to be a long email so bear with me.

## Lecture
Class lectures will be held over Zoom at the regular class time of 9:30-10:20 and can be accessed with the following link:

* I will post lecture recordings online (probably Piazza) after class

* Lectures will deliberately run short (30-40 mins), and the remaining time will be used for a discussion.

* There are written notes for all lectures which are required reading before class. 

## Assignments
There will be 4 programming assignments (probably requring 4-8 hours of work each). TA's will assist you with those assignments with special Zoom sessions and Piazza. Assignments will be submitted through gitlab. 

I strongly believe in student collaboration on computer systems assignments, and acknowledging that collaboration will be difficult these assignments have been significantly simplified from previous quarters.

## Exams
In lieu of a more assignment heavy class, the class will have two midterms and a final exam. All of the exams, will be take home exams and graded on the honor system. The exams will be emailed to you and electronically submitted. The exams are designed to be 2 hr tests but you will be given an entire weekend to do them. This leeway should be sufficient for any students with disability accomodations or a less than ideal work environment at home.

* MT Exam 1. April 24th - 26th
* MT Exam 2. May 15th - 17th

## Grading
As of now, the college has not made a decision on a blanket P/F policy like some of our peer-institutions. I find this indecisive and callous, and with my own discretion, I plan on a "backstop" grading policy:

* Students can indicate a change to grading option (P/F or Quality Grade) AFTER seeing their final grade. 

* The bar for a P is reasonable completion of all 4 programming assignments before the grading deadline. 

* Incomplete and Withdrawal options can be requested at any time and will be given no questions asked.
