# Introduction to Data Engineering
Data-driven models are revolutionizing science and industry. Scalable systems are needed to collect, stream, process, 
and validate data at scale. This course is an introduction to “big” data engineering where students will 
understand the principles of building such systems. Since such courses are being developed all over the country,
I have decided to open-source my materials. Below is a example schedule for a 10 week course (28 lectures).
