    "# Lecture 3. Systems and Examples\n",
    "In the last lecture, we covered the concept of an operator. In this lecture, we discuss systems composed of different parametrized families of these operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recap. Streaming Model of Computation\n",
    "The key insight of the previous lecture(s) is that data-intensive systems (ones that process a large amount of data) are most suited for a \"streaming\" model of computation rather than a static one. The main insight was a processing paradigm where the data that serves as input to a function or a program is an infinite sequence. To recap,\n",
    "\n",
    "* An iterator is an object that can initialize a data stream and return each `next` element when it is queried.\n",
    "* Iterators can be chained, manipulated, filtered, and transformed with operators.\n",
    "* Iterators can hide latency through lazy execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do iterators and operators form the basic building blocks for a data intensive system?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Atomic Values and Tuples\n",
    "We've so far talked about data in the abstract. When we build actual systems, we will have to get more precise. While in principle, we can iterate over any data types or structures, building rigid restrictions will help us better understand the behavior of said systems. We will work with systems that follow the following axioms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Every system defines *atomic* data values. An atomic data type is one that are indivisible, dereferenced, and stateless in the systems eyes. This is similar to the concept of primitive types in programming languages.\n",
    "* Every operator iterates over a fixed size tuple (an immutable array) of atomic values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try to understand why we have these restrictions by illustrating some analogies in python. Here is an example of an allowed iteration: "
