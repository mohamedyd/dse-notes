# Data Extraction
Loading data into a structured format, such as a relational database or a dataframe, is an under-appreciated challenge in data engineering. In fact, the process of extracting structured fields from even already reasonably structured data (like CSV files) is not trivial. This phase of data analysis is often called extract, transform, load (or ETL for short).There are three database functions that are combined into tools to pull data out of a raw format and place it into another database.

* Extract is the process of reading data from a database. In this stage, the data is collected,
often from multiple and different types of sources.
* Transform is the process of converting the extracted data from its previous form into the
form it needs to be in so that it can be placed into another database. Transformation occurs
by using rules or lookup tables or by combining the data with other data.
* Load is the process of writing the data into the target database
