# What Is Data?

"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it." -George Santayana

Recounting events that have ocurred in the past is a fundemental part of the human experience. The first histories were described by oral traditions passed on from generation to generation. Then, these oral traditions gave way to written accounts of the past. Now, in the modern era, events are documented digitally through media such as audio and video. How do we describe the accumulation of such knowledge over time? Herein defines the abstract concept of *data*. A *datum* is a unit of information---an atomic observation about the world. Data (yes it is plural!) is a collection of such observations.

The basic motivation of this endeavor is *prediction*, i.e., understanding what has happened in the past to be able to know how to act in the future. Therefore, the science of working with data is understanding how and when such predictions work, and judging their reliability. Data Science is essentially the theory of principled prediction.

If data has been around for millenia, why are we studying this now? In short, a confluence of technological and social factors has led to a proliferation of shareable data over the last 40 years.

- Digitization. The invention of the microchip and other semiconductor technologies means that information can be captured, stored, and transferred electronically. 

- Price of storage. Since the mid 1980s, the cost of storing data has reduced by a factor of 35 million. So the economics of data collection have fundementally changed. If your data could possible provide any predictive value for you in the future---you might as well store it because storage is so cheap.

- Standardization and the internet. The advent of the internet forced hardware and software to be interoperable---and more importantly could share and interpret each other's data. In the 1990s, we see a solidification of the popular data formats that we take for granted for documents (PDFs), music (mp3), and video (mpeg).

-  Machine learning and the rebirth of AI. Crucially the 2000s also ushered in a new software engineering paradigm based on Machine Learning. The idea that historical data could be used to "train" software to perform tasks better than any human code code changed the way we think about the value of data. 

## Types of Data
Philisophically, data can literally be anything. However, it is useful to taxonomize digital data into
